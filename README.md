# 🛎️ Booking Cancellation Analysis

An analytical deep dive into hotel booking data, focused on understanding the factors that drive booking cancellations and uncovering strategies to reduce them.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes hotel booking data to:
- Identify patterns and trends in booking cancellations
- Determine the key features that influence whether a booking is canceled
- Provide actionable recommendations to minimize cancellation rates
- (Optional) Build a predictive model to forecast potential cancellations

## 📁 Dataset Information

- **Source:** [Hotel Booking Demand Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)
- **Main Fields:**
  - `hotel` (City Hotel or Resort Hotel)
  - `is_canceled`
  - `lead_time`
  - `arrival_date`
  - `stays_in_weekend_nights`, `stays_in_week_nights`
  - `market_segment`
  - `deposit_type`
  - `customer_type`
  - `special_requests`
  - `assigned_room_type`

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Modeling (Optional):** Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- **Data Exploration:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Dashboard (Optional):** Power BI / Tableau

## 🧠 Key Questions Addressed

- What percentage of bookings get canceled?
- How do hotel type, lead time, and deposit policy affect cancellations?
- Does the number of special requests correlate with booking commitment?
- What booking channels have the highest cancellation rates?
- Can we predict if a booking will be canceled?

---

## 📈 Insights & Findings

- **Higher lead times are strongly associated with increased cancellations.**
- **City hotels have slightly higher cancellation rates compared to resort hotels.**
- **Non-refundable deposits significantly reduce cancellation likelihood.**
- **Guests who make special requests are less likely to cancel.**
- **Bookings from online travel agencies show the highest cancellation rates.**
